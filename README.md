# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a list of data science projects I worked on for academic and self learning purposes. The projects are either written in R or Python. 

Tools:

- **Python**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras

## Projects

- [Collaborative Filtering using a Trust Social Network with Deep Learning for Initialization](https://github.com/weijiazzz/data-science/blob/project/cf/collaborative_filtering/cf_with_trust.pdf): Developed a Recommender System algorithm that utilizes a trust social network. Community detection was leveraged on the social network to detect groups of users with shared interests. Deep learning was used to search for a better initialization in the non-convex optimization problem. Experimental results on the [Epinion](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/datasetcode/truststudy.htm) dataset were demonstrated.
